# LLM Engineering Discovery

This repository contains my personal learning journey and explorations based on **Ed Donner's "Mastering LLM Engineering"** course.

üéì **Course Repository**: https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering

## üìñ About This Repository

This is a personal discovery and learning repository where I explore concepts, complete assignments, and experiment with Large Language Model engineering techniques from the comprehensive 8-week course by Ed Donner.

### Course Overview

The original course covers:

- **Week 1**: Foundations & Setup
- **Week 2**: Core LLM Concepts
- **Week 3**: Advanced Techniques
- **Week 4**: Vector Databases & RAG
- **Week 5**: LLM Agents & Function Calling
- **Week 6**: Multi-Agent Systems
- **Week 7**: Production & Deployment
- **Week 8**: Advanced Topics & Capstone

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `assignments/` ‚Äì Final versions of assignment notebooks
- `notebooks/` ‚Äì Exploratory work and research notes
- `prompts/` ‚Äì Saved prompt templates and variations
- `data/` ‚Äì Input/output data files and datasets
- `experiments/` ‚Äì Personal experiments and proof-of-concepts

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Git
- API keys for various LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### 1. Clone and Setup Environment

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd llm_engineering_discovery

# Create Python environment using Anaconda
conda create -n llm-engineering python=3.11
conda activate llm-engineering

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure your API keys:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your actual API keys
```

Required environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` - OpenAI API key
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Anthropic API key
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY` - Google AI API key
- Other provider keys as needed

### 3. Start Jupyter Lab

```bash
jupyter lab
```

## üîß Tools & Technologies

This repository utilizes the following key technologies from the course:

- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, Ollama
- **Frameworks**: LangChain, LlamaIndex, Transformers
- **Vector Databases**: ChromaDB, Pinecone
- **Development**: Jupyter Lab, Python, Git
- **Deployment**: Modal, Gradio, Streamlit

## üìö Learning Resources

- **Original Course**: [ed-donner/llm_engineering](https://github.com/ed-donner/llm_engineering)
- **Setup Guides**: Available for Mac, PC, and Linux in the original repo
- **Community**: Course Discord and community contributions
